## When and where will our app be used?
Scenario1.<br />
Alice is a new mom with a 1-month-old baby, and she's looking for an easy way to track when her baby feeds and sleeps. Our app is the perfect solution for her! With just one click, Alice can record the time her baby feeds or sleeps and label it accordingly - for example, she might label a log as 'feed' or 'sleep'. The best part? She can reuse these labels later, making it even easier to track her baby's schedule. In the app's logs view, Alice can quickly sort through her baby's feeding and sleeping times based on her labels. This makes it simple for her to keep track of her baby's routine and identify any patterns or changes.

Scenario2.<br />
Bob needs to take medication every morning, but sometimes he forgets whether he's already taken it or not. Whenever he takes his medication, he can easily open the app and record the time he took it. This way, he can keep track of when he's taken his medication and avoid any accidental overdoses.

Scenario3.<br />
Charlie is a running enthusiast who loves to track his progress. With our app, he can easily record the duration of his runs. When he starts his run, he can clock in using the app, and when he finishes, he can clock out. This way, he can keep track of how long he runs each day.

## How will our app be used?
Our app has three great features that make it easy to record, label, and track your time:<br />
First, with just one simple click, you can record the time in the app's first view. You don't need to go through any more steps - it's that easy! You can always edit or label the time later if you need to.<br />
Second, our app allows you to label your recorded time. When you label a time, the label automatically appears in the first view recording times. This means that if you often record the same type of activity, such as 'feed' or 'sleep', you can click the labeled button and avoid the need to label the time later.<br />
Finally, in the time logs view, you can easily sort your recorded times based on your labels. This makes it simple to track and analyze your time records. Whether you're trying to keep track of your daily routine or measure your progress towards a specific goal, our app makes it easy to stay organized.
